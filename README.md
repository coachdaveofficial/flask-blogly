# flask-blogly

Blogly is an app I made to practice my skills in Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy using PostgresQL.

Keypoints include:

1. Full CRUD for Users, Posts, and Tags
2. Many-to-many relationship in database for Tags
3. Timestamp for each Post that lists the time it was created
4. Unit tests for main routes
